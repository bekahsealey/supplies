        Welcome to the Back to School Supply List Management App!
    </h2>
    <p>
        Managing Back to School with multiple children can get overwhelming. This app allows a family to import their supply lists for each child according to their school and grade level, allowing adjustment of totals according to supplies already on hand, and creating a corporate list of supplies yet to be purchased.
